# Fed - A Toy Editor Inspired by Neovim

## Introduction

**Fed** is a toy text editor written in Rust, inspired by the powerful and extensible Neovim. It aims to provide a simplified yet efficient editing experience, drawing on the best aspects of Neovim's interface and capabilities.

## Features

- **Modal Editing**: Like Neovim, Fed supports modal editing, separating text entry from command execution.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Basic syntax highlighting for a variety of programming languages.
- **Extensibility**: While simpler than Neovim, Fed can be extended with plugins written in Rust.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with multiple operating systems, thanks to Rust's cross-platform capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust Programming Language: Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Terminal: Fed is a terminal-based editor, so a command-line interface is required.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fed.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fed
   ```
3. Build the project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
4. Run the editor:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/fed
   ```

## Usage

- **Modes**: Switch between different modes (insert, command, etc.) as in Neovim.
- **Opening Files**: To open a file, use `:open <filename>` in command mode.
- **Saving Files**: Save your changes with `:w` or `:wq` to write and quit.
